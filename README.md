So much to do...

[ ] Clean up UI of `basic` scaffold and add more comments into routes, views and services
[ ] Add `README.md` file to project scaffolds
[ ] Update documentation provided in new apps to better reflect need-to-know info
[ ] Update this README to include more info on how `create-panda-app` works and its flags & configuration
[ ] Add new scaffold(s) for other base app types (React, Lit, etc)
[ ] Tie build process into existing scaffolds
[ ] Build in live-updating of content
[ ] Update `--interactive` flag to run list of input questions
